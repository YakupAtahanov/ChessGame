This is a chess game model, which I decided to create on Python using arcade and nodules. Chess module didn't have any GUI, and you can only play on coonsole with the letters assigned to the pieces.
My code, however, aims to intagrate the chess module to GUI using arcade module.
I am planning on looking for much more effective options other than arcade module. If you have any suggestions, please let me know :)
